### Sitecore
Sitecore's authoring interface represents a breakthrough in usability and design, and offers unrivaled ease of use. Our In-Line editing lets editors simply click on parts of the website to edit, without complications. No matter what skill level your content editors have, they'll be easily managing their Sitecore website in minutes.

Sitecore’s Page Editor technology provides a role-based interface that delivers exactly the right amount of capability to a user based on their needs.

For the casual user, the page editor presents a streamlined interface that allows them to navigate their site naturally, and simply type within the pages to make editorial changes. The more sophisticated user can be given a more active role in managing the site, including workflow control, metadata management, page design capabilities as well as publishing rights. By segmenting these users into different roles, the CMS automatically tailors the user interface to present the right amount of capabilities to the right user.
