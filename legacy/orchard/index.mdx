## Overview

Orchard is a free, open source, community-focused project aimed at delivering applications and reusable components on the rock-solid ASP.NET MVC platform. In our opinion it is the best architected CMS framework around and is built on top of the ASP.NET MVC framework.

## Benefits
- Individual .NET-based applications that appeal to end-users, designers, developers, and Web professionals
- A set of re-usable components that makes it easy to build such applications
- A vibrant community to help define these applications and extensions
